    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi stew is a classic Korean dish. It's also a relatively simple dish but has a lot of flavor. I like to add spam to it, which is pretty non-traditional, but super delicious.
        A good kimchi stew uses really fermented kimchi.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of fermented kimchi</li>
        <li>1 can of spam</li>
        <li>1 tsp of sesame oil</li>
        <li>White rice of choice</li>
        <li>1 green onion (garnish)</li>
        <li>1 quarter white or yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice your onions, garlic, green onions, and spam.</li>
        <li>In a pot, add your sesame oil and start cooking your kimchi, garlic, and onions over medium high heat until kimchi turns translucent</li>
        <li>Add in your water</li>

    </ol>
